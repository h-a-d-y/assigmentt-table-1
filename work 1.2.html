        <td>In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee<br>, a contractor at CERN,<br> proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, <br>a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents.<br> In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an <br>Internet-based hypertext system.<br>[6] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser <br>and server software in late 1990. That year,<br> Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert <br>Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding,<br> but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. <br>In his personal notes[7] from 1990 he listed[8] <br>"some of the many areas in which hypertext is<br> used" and put an encyclopedia first.<br> 
The first publicly available description of HTML was<br> a document called "HTML Tags", first mentioned on the<br> Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.<br>[9][10] It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, <br>relatively simple design of HTML.<br> Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly<br> influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house Standard Generalized <br>Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN.<br> Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.[11] </td>
        <td>HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text,<br> images, and other material into visual or audible web pages.<br> Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser,<br> and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's<br> additional use of CSS. Many of the text elements are found<br> in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for<br> using SGML, which in turn covers the features of early text formatting languages <br>such as that used by the RUNOFF command developed in the early 1960s for the <br>CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system: these formatting commands were de<br>rived from the commands used by typesetters to manually format documents. Ho<br>wever, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements <br> (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely print effec<br> ts, with also the separation of svtructure v<br> and markup; HTML has been progre<br> ssively moved in this direction with CSS. </td>
        <td>Berners-Lee considered HTML to be an application of SGML.<br> It was formally defined as such by the Internet Engineering<br> Task Force (IETF) with the mid-1993 publication o<br>f the first proposal for an H<br>TML specification, the "Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)" Interne<br>t Draft by Berners-Lee and Dan Connolly, which incl<br>uded an SGML Document type definition to define the <br>grammar.[12][13] The draft expired after six months, but wa<br>s notable for its acknowledgment of the NCSA Mosaic <br>browser's custom tag for embedding in-line images, reflecti<br>ng the IETF's philosophy of basing standards on success<br>ful prototypes.[14] Similarly, Dave Raggett's competing Internet-Draft, "H<br>TML+ (Hypertext Markup Format)", from late 1993, suggested st<br>andardizing already-implemented feat<br>ures like tables and fill-out forms.</td>
